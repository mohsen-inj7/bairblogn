# Model Training Can Be Slow

In deep learning, using more compute (e.g., increasing model size, dataset
size, or training steps) often leads to higher accuracy. This is especially
true given the recent success of unsupervised pretraining methods like
[BERT][1], which can scale up training to very large models and datasets.
Unfortunately, large-scale training is very computationally expensive,
especially without the hardware resources of large industry research labs.
Thus, the goal in practice is usually to get high accuracy without exceeding
one’s hardware budget and training time.

For most training budgets, very large models appear impractical. Instead, the
go-to strategy for maximizing training efficiency is to use models with small
hidden sizes or few layers because these models run faster and use less memory.

# Larger Models Train Faster

However, in our [recent paper][2], we show that this common practice of
reducing model size is actually the opposite of the best compute-efficient
training strategy. Instead, when training [Transformer][3] models on a budget,
you want to drastically *increase model size but stop training very early*. In
other words, we rethink the implicit assumption that models must be trained
*until convergence* by demonstrating the opportunity to increase model size
while sacrificing convergence.

This phenomenon occurs because larger models converge to lower test error in
fewer gradient updates than smaller models. Moreover, this increase in
convergence outpaces the extra computational cost of using larger models.
Consequently, when considering wall-clock training time, larger models achieve
higher accuracy faster.

We demonstrate this trend in the two training curves below. On the left, we
plot the validation error for pretraining [RoBERTa][4], a variant of BERT. The
deeper RoBERTa models achieve lower [perplexity][5] than the shallower models
for a given wall clock time (our paper shows the same is true for wider
models). This trend also holds for machine translation. On the right, we plot
the validation BLEU score (higher is better) when training an English-French
Transformer machine translation model. The deeper and wider models achieve
higher BLEU score than smaller models given the same training time.

Interestingly, for pretraining RoBERTa, increasing model width and/or depth
both lead to faster training. For machine translation, wider models outperform
deeper models. We thus recommend to try increasing width before going deeper.

We also recommend *increasing model size, not batch size*. Concretely, we
confirm that once the batch size is near a [critical range][6], increasing the
batch size only provides marginal improvements in wall-clock training time.
Thus, when under resource constraints, we recommend to use a batch size inside
this critical region and then to use larger model sizes.

# But What About Test Time?

Although larger models are more *training-efficient*, they also increase the
computational and memory requirements of *inference*. This is problematic
because the total cost of inference is much larger than the cost of training
for most real-world applications. However, for RoBERTa, we show that this
trade-off can be reconciled with model compression. In particular, larger
models are more robust to model compression techniques than small models. Thus,
one can get the best of both worlds by *training very large models and then
heavily compressing them*.

We demonstrate our findings with the compression methods of quantization and
pruning. Quantization stores model weights in low precision formats; pruning
sets certain neural network weights to zero. Both methods can reduce the
inference latency and memory requirements of storing model weights.

*Compression Results*. We first pretrain RoBERTa models of different sizes for
the same *total wall-clock time*. We then finetune these models on a downstream
text classification task (MNLI) and apply either pruning or quantization. We
find that the best models for a given test-time budget are the models that are
trained very large and then heavily compressed.

For example, consider the pruning results for the deepest model (orange curve
in the left Figure below). Without pruning the model, it reaches high accuracy
but uses about 200 million parameters (and thus lots of memory and compute).
However, this model can be heavily pruned (the points moving to the left along
the curve) without considerably hurting accuracy. This is in stark contrast to
the smaller models, e.g., the 6 layer model shown in pink, whose accuracy
heavily degrades after pruning. A similar trend occurs for quantization (right
Figure below). Overall, the best model for most test budgets (pick a point on
the x-axis) are the very large but heavily compressed models.

# Conclusion

We have shown that increasing Transformer model size can improve the efficiency
of training and inference, i.e., one should *Train Large, Then Compress*. This
finding leads to many other interesting questions such as *why* larger models
converge faster and compress better. In [our paper][2], we present initial
investigations into this phenomenon, however, future work is still required.
Moreover, our findings are currently specific to NLP---we would like to explore
how these conclusions generalize to other domains like computer vision.
