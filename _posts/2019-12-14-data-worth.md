People give massive amounts of their personal data to companies every day,
which use these data to generate tremendous business values. Some
[economists](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-much-your-private-data-worth-who-should-own-it)
and
[politicians](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/17/andrew-yang-facebook-amazon-google-should-pay-for-users-data.html)
argue that people should get paid for their contributions---but the
million-dollar question is: by how much?

This article discusses methods proposed in our recent
[AISTATS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10275.pdf) and
[VLDB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08619.pdf) papers that attempt to answer this
question in the machine learning context. This is joint work with David Dao,
Boxin Wang, Frances Ann Hubis, Nezihe Merve Gurel, Nick Hynes, Bo Li, Ce Zhang,
Costas J. Spanos, and Dawn Song, as well as a collaborative effort between UC
Berkeley, ETH Zurich, and UIUC. More information about the work in our group

# What are existing approaches to data valuation?

Various ad-hoc data valuation schemes have been studied in the literature and
some of them have been deployed in the existing data marketplaces. From a
practitioner’s point of view, they can be grouped into three categories:

- **Query-based pricing** attaches values to user-initiated queries. One simple
  example is to set the price based on the number of queries allowed during a
  time window. [Other more sophisticated
  examples](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~suciu/file07_paper.pdf) attempt to
  adjust the price to some specific criteria, such as arbitrage avoidance.

- [**Data attribute-based
  pricing**](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/73449/207_ready.pdf?sequence=2)
  constructs a price model that takes into account various parameters, such as
  data age, credibility, potential benefits and so on. The model is trained to
  match market prices released in public datasets.

- [**Auction-based
  pricing**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5466993) designs
  auctions that dynamically set the price based on bids offered by buyers and
  sellers.

However, existing data valuation schemes do not take into account the following
important desiderata:

- Task-specificness: The value of data depends on the task it helps to fulfill.
  For instance, if Alice’s medical record indicates that she has disease A,
  then her data will be more useful to predict disease A as opposed to other
  diseases.

- Fairness: The quality of data from different sources varies dramatically. In
  the worst case, adversarial data source may even degrade model performance
  via data poisoning attacks. Hence, the data value should reflect the efficacy
  of data by assigning high values to data which can notably improve the model
  performance.

- Efficiency: Practical machine learning tasks may involve thousands or
  billions of data contributors; thus, data valuation techniques should be
  capable of scaling up.

With the above desiderata, we now discuss a principled notion of data value and
computationally efficient algorithms for data valuation.

# What would be a good notion for data value?


Due to its task-specific nature, data’s value should depend on the utility of
the machine learning model trained on the data. Suppose that the machine
learning model generates a specific amount of profit. Then, we can reduce the
data valuation problem to a profit allocation problem, which splits the total
utility of the machine learning model between different data sources. Indeed,
it is a well-studied problem in cooperative game theory to fairly allocate
profits created by collective efforts. The most prominent profit allocation
scheme is the Shapley value. The Shapley value attaches a real-value number to
each player in the game to indicate the relative importance of their
contributions. Specifically, for $N$ players, the Shapley value of the player
$i$ ($i\in I=\{1,\ldots,N\}$) is defined as

$$
s_i = \sum_{S\subseteq I\setminus\{i\}} \frac{1}{N{N-1\choose |S|}}[U(S\cup \{i\})-U(S)]
$$

where $U(S)$ is the utility function that evaluates the worth of the player
subset S. From the above definition, we observe that the difference in the
bracket measures how much the payoff increases when player $i$ is added to a
particular subset $S$; thus, the Shapley value measures the average
contribution of player $i$ to every possible group of other players in the
game.

Relating these game theoretic concepts to the problem of data valuation, one
can think of the players as training data sources, and accordingly, the utility
function $U(S)$ as a performance measure of the model trained on the subset S
of training data. Thus, the Shapley value can be used to determine the value of
each data source. The Shapley value is appealing because it is the only profit
allocation scheme that satisfies the following properties:

- Group rationality: the total utility of the machine learning model is
  completely split between different data sources, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^N s_i =
  U(I)$. This is a natural requirement because data contributors would expect
  the total benefit to be fully distributed.

- Fairness: Two data sources which have identical contributions to the model
  utility should have the same value; moreover, users with zero marginal
  contributions to all subsets of the dataset should not receive any payoff.

- Additivity: The values under multiple utilities sum up to the value under a
  utility that is the sum of all these utilities. This property generalizes the
  data valuation for multiple tasks. Specifically, if each task is associated
  with a utility function as the performance measure, with the additivity
  property, we can calculate the multi-task data value by simply computing the
  Shapley value with respect to the aggregated utility function.

Because of the aforementioned properties and its task-dependent nature, we
employ the Shapley value to determine the contribution of each training data in
fulfilling a machine learning task.  While the outlined concept appears
plausible, it has some fundamental challenges: Computing the Shapley value, in
general, requires to evaluate the utility function for an exponential number of
times; even worse, evaluating the utility function means to re-train the model
in a machine learning context.  This is clearly intractable even for a small
dataset. Interestingly, by focusing on the machine learning context, some
opportunities arise to address the scalability challenge. Next, we show that
for K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification, one can obviate the need to
re-train models and compute the Shapley value in  time---an exponential
improvement in computational efficiency!

# Efficient algorithms for KNN

To understand why KNN is amenable to efficient data valuation, we consider
$K=1$ and investigate the following simple utility function defined for 1NN:
$U(S)=1$ if the label of a test point is correctly predicted by its nearest
neighbor in $S$ and $0$ otherwise. For a given test point, the utility of a set
is completely determined by the nearest neighbor in this set to the test point.
Thus, the contribution of the point $i$ to a subset $S$ is zero if the nearest
neighbor in S is closer to the test point than $i$. When we reexamine the
Shapley value, we observe that for many $S$, $U(S\cup\{i\})-U(S)=0$.
Figure 1 illustrates an example of such $S$. This simple example shows the
computational requirement of Shapley value can be significantly reduced for
KNN.

computation.

</p>

In general, for a given test point $(x_\text{test},y_\text{test})$, we let
$\alpha_k(S)$ denote the $k$th nearest neighbor in $S$ to the test point.
Consider the following utility function that measures the likelihood of
predicting the right label of a particular test point for KNN,

$$
U(S) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{\min\{K,|S|\}}\mathbb{1}[y_{\alpha_k(S)}=y_\text{test}]
$$

Now assume that the training data is sorted according to their similarity to
the test point. We develop a simple recursive algorithm to compute the Shapley
value of all training points from the farthest neighbor of the test point to
the nearest one. Let $\mathbb{I}[\cdot]$ represent the indicator function.
Then, the algorithm proceeds as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
    &s_N = \frac{\mathbb{I}[y_N=y_\text{test}]}{N}\\
    &s_i = s_{i+1} + \frac{\mathbb{I}[y_i=y_\text{test}]-\mathbb{I}[y_{i+1}=y_\text{test}]}{K} \frac{\min\{K,i\}}{i}
\end{align*}
$$

This algorithm can be extended to the case where the utility is defined as the
likelihood of predicting the right labels for multiple test points. By the
additivity property, the Shapley value for multiple test points is the sum of
the Shapley value for every single test point. The computational complexity is
$\mathcal{O}(N\log NN_\text{test})$ for $N$ training points and $N_\text{test}$
test points---this is simply the complexity of a sorting algorithm!

We can also develop a similar recursive algorithm to compute the Shapley value
for KNN regression. Moreover, in some applications such as document retrieval,
test points could arrive sequentially and the value of each training point
needs to get updated and accumulated on the fly, which makes it impossible to
complete sorting offline. But sorting a large dataset with high dimension in an
online manner will be expensive. To address the scalability challenge in the
online setting, we develop an approximation algorithm to compute the Shapley
value for KNN with improved efficiency. The efficiency boost is achieved by
utilizing the locality-sensitive hashing to circumvent the need of sorting.
More details of these extensions can be found in [our
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08619.pdf).

# Improving the efficiency for other ML models

The Shapley value for KNN is efficient due to the special locality structure.
For general machine learning models, exact computation of the Shapley value is
inevitably slower. To address this challenge, prior work often resorts to Monte
Carlo-based approximation algorithms. The central idea behind these
approximation algorithms is to treat the Shapley value of a training point as
its expected contribution to a random subset and use sample average to
approximate the expectation. By the definition of the Shapley value, the random
set has size $0$ to $N-1$ with equal probability (corresponding to the $1/N$
factor) and is also equally likely to be any subset of a given size
(corresponding to the $1/{N-1\choose |S|}$ factor). In practice, one can
implement an equivalent sampler by drawing a random permutation of the training
set. Then, the approximation algorithm proceeds by computing the marginal
utility of a point to the points preceding it and averaging the marginal
utilities across different permutations. This was the state-of-the-art method
to estimate the Shapley value for general utility functions (referred to as the
baseline approximation later). To assess the performance of an approximation
algorithm, we can look at the number of utility evaluation needed to achieve
some guarantees of the approximation error. Using Hoeffding’s bound, it can be
proved that the above baseline approximation algorithm needs
$\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ so that the squared error between the estimated and
the ground truth Shapley value is bounded with high probability. Can we reduce
the number of utility evaluations while maintaining the same approximation
error guarantee?

We developed an approximation algorithm that requires only sublinear
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}(\log N)^2)$ utility evaluations by utilizing the
information sharing between different random samples. The key idea is that if a
data point has a high value, it tends to boost the utility of all subsets
containing it. This inspires us to draw some random subsets and record the
presence of each training point in these randomly selected subsets. Denoting
the appearance of the $i$th and $j$th training data by $\beta_i$ and $\beta_j$.
We can smartly design the distribution of the random subsets so that the
expectation of $(\beta_i-\beta_j)U(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_N)$ is equal to
$s_i-s_j$. We can pick an anchor point, say, $s_1$, and use the sample average
of $(\beta_i-\beta_1)U(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_N)$ for all $i=2,\ldots,N$ to
estimate the Shapley value difference from all other training points to $s_1$.
Then, we can just perform a few more utility evaluations to estimate $s_1$,
which allows us to recover the Shapley value of all other points.  More details
of this algorithm can be found in [our
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10275.pdf). Since this algorithm computes the
Shapley value by simply examining the utility of groups of data, we will refer
to this algorithm as the *group testing-based approximation* hereinafter.  Our
paper also discusses even more efficient ways to estimate the Shapley value
when there are new assumptions that can be made about the machine learning
models, such as sparsity of the Shapley values and the stability of the
underlying learning algorithm.

# Experiments

We first demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method to compute the exact
Shapley value for KNN. We benchmark the runtime on a machine learning task
using a 2.6 GHZ Intel Core i7 CPU and compare the exact algorithm with the
Monte Carlo-based approximation (baseline). Figure 2(a) shows the Monte-Carlo
estimate of the Shapley value for each training point converges to the result
of the exact algorithm with enough simulations, thus indicating the correctness
of our exact algorithm. More importantly, the exact algorithm is several orders
of magnitude faster than the baseline approximation as shown in Figure 2(b).

With the proposed algorithm, for the first time, we can compute data values for
a practically large database. Figure 3 illustrates the result of a large-scale
experiment using the KNN Shapley value. We take all 1.5 million images with
pre-calculated features and labels from Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100
Million (YFCC100m) dataset. We observe that the KNN Shapley value is
intuitive--the top valued images are semantically correlated with the
corresponding test image. This experiment takes only few seconds per test image
on a single CPU and can be parallelized for a large test set.

Similarly, Figure 4(a) demonstrate the accuracy of our proposed group
testing-based approximation and Figure 4(b) shows that group testing-based
method outperforms the baseline approximation by several orders of magnitude
for a large number of data points.

algorithm and the baseline approximation algorithm for a logistic regression

</p>

We also perform experiments to demonstrate the utility of the Shapley value
beyond data marketplace applications. Since the Shapley value tells us how
useful a data point is for a machine learning task, we can use it to identify
the low-quality or even adversarial data points in the training set. As a
simple example, we artificially create a training set with half of the data
directly from MNIST and the other half perturbed with random noise. In Figure
5, we compare the Shapley value between normal and noisy data as the noise
ratio gets higher. The figure shows that the Shapley value can be used to
effectively detect noisy training data.

magnitude gets higher.

</p>

The Shapley value can also be used to understand adversarial training, which is
an effective method to improve the adversarial robustness of a model by
introducing adversarial examples to the training dataset.. In practice, we
measure the robustness in terms of the test accuracy on a dataset containing
adversarial examples. We expect that the adversarial examples in the training
dataset become more valuable as more adversarial examples are added into the
test dataset. Based on the MNIST, we construct a training dataset that contains
both benign and adversarial examples and synthesize test datasets with
different adversarial-benign mixing ratios. Two popular attack algorithms,
namely, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the iterative attack (CW) are used
to generate adversarial examples. Figure 6 (a) and (b) compare the average
Shapley value for adversarial examples and for benign examples in the training
dataset. The negative test loss for logistic regression is used as the utility
function. We see that the Shapley value of adversarial examples increases as
the test data becomes more adversarial; on the contrary, the Shapley value of
benign examples decreases. In addition, the adversarial examples in the
training set are more valuable if they are generated from the same attack
algorithm during test time.

# Conclusion

We hope that our approaches for data valuation provide the theoretical and
computational tools to facilitate data collection and dissemination in future
data marketplaces. Beyond data markets, the Shapley value is a versatile tool
for machine learning practitioners; for instance, it can be used for selecting
features or interpreting black-box model predictions. Our algorithms can also
be applied to mitigate the computational challenges in these important
applications.
