<p>
You’ve decided that you want to bike from your house by UC Berkeley to the
Golden Gate Bridge. It’s a nice 20 mile ride, but there’s a problem: you’ve
never ridden a bike before! To make matters worse, you are new to the Bay Area,
and all you have is a good ol’ fashion map to guide you. How do you get started?
</p>

<p>
Let’s first figure out how to ride a bike. One strategy would be to do a lot of
studying and planning. Read books on how to ride bicycles. Study physics and
anatomy. Plan out all the different muscle movements that you’ll make in
response to each perturbation. This approach is noble, but for anyone who’s ever
learned to ride a bike, they know that this strategy is doomed to fail. There’s
only one way to learn how to ride a bike: trial and error. Some tasks like
riding a bike are just too complicated to plan out in your head.  </p>

<p>
Once you’ve learned how to ride your bike, how would you get to the Golden Gate
Bridge? You could reuse your trial-and-error strategy. Take a few random turns
and see if you end up at the Golden Gate Bridge. Unfortunately, this strategy
would take a very, very long time. For this sort of problem, planning is a much
faster strategy, and requires considerably less real-world experience and
trial-and-error. In reinforcement learning terms, it is more
<i>sample-efficient</i>.

</p>

<p>
While simple, this thought experiment highlights some important aspects of human
intelligence. For some tasks, we use a trial-and-error approach, and for others
we use a planning approach. A similar phenomena seems to have emerged in
reinforcement learning (RL). In the parlance of RL, empirical results show that
some tasks are better suited for model-free (trial-and-error) approaches, and
others are better suited for model-based (planning) approaches.  </p>

<p>
However, the biking analogy also highlights that the two systems are not
completely independent. In particularly, to say that learning to ride a bike is
<i>just</i> trial-and-error is an oversimplification. In fact, when learning to
bike by trial-and-error, you’ll employ a bit of planning. Perhaps your plan will
initially be, “Don’t fall over.” As you improve, you’ll make more ambitious
plans, such as, “Bike forwards for two meters without falling over.” Eventually,
your bike-riding skills will be so proficient that you can start to plan in very
abstract terms (“Bike to the end of the road.”) to the point that all there is
left to do is planning and you no longer need to worry about the nitty-gritty
details of riding a bike. We see that there is a gradual transition from the
model-free (trial-and-error) strategy to a model-based (planning) strategy. If
we could develop artificial intelligence algorithms--and specifically RL
algorithms--that mimic this behavior, it could result in an algorithm that both
performs well (by using trial-and-error methods early on) and is sample
efficient (by later switching to a planning approach to achieve more abstract
goals).
</p>

<p>
This post covers temporal difference model (TDM), which is a RL algorithm that
captures this smooth transition between model-free and model-based RL. Before
describing TDMs, we start by first describing how a typical model-based RL
algorithm works.

<h2 id="model-based-reinforcement-learning">Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</h2>

<p>
In reinforcement learning, we have some some state space $\mathcal{S}$ and
action space $\mathcal{A}$. If at time $t$ we are in state $s_t \in \mathcal{S}$
and take action $a_t\in \mathcal{A}$, we transition to a new state $s_{t+1} =
f(s_t, a_t)$ according to a dynamics model $f: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A}
\mapsto \mathcal{S}$. The goal is to maximize rewards summed over the visited
state: $\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} r(s_t, a_, s_{t+1})$. Model-based RL algorithms assume
you are given (or learn) the dynamics model $f$. Given this dynamics model,
there are a variety of model-based algorithms. For this post, we consider
methods that perform the following optimization to choose a sequence of actions
and states to maximize rewards: 
</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
  \qquad \text{max}_{a_{1:T-1}, s_{1:T}} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) \text{ subject to }f(s_t, a_t) = s_{t+1}
</script>

<p>
  The optimization says to choose a sequence of states and actions that you maximize the rewards, while ensuring that the trajectory is feasible. Here, feasible means that each state-action-next-state transition is valid. For example, in the image below if you start in state $s_t$ and take action $a_t$, only the top $s_{t+1}$ results in a feasible transition.
</p>

that only trajectories like the top row will be outputted. The bottom two
trajectories may have high reward, but they’re not feasible.
</i>
</p>

<p>
In our biking problem, the optimization might result in a biking plan from
Berkeley (top right) to the Golden Gate Bridge (middle left) that looks like
this:

</i>
</p>

<p>
While conceptually nice, this plan is not very realistic. Model-based approaches
use a model $f(s, a)$ that predict the state at the very next time step. In
robotics, a time step usually corresponds to a tenth or a hundredth of a second.
So perhaps a more realistic depiction of the resulting plan might look like:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">

/><br />
<i>
A more realistic plan.
</i>
</p>

<p>
If we think about how we plan in everyday life, we realize that we plan at much
more temporally abstract terms. Rather than planning the position that our bike
will be at the next tenth of a second, we make longer-term plans like, “I
will go to the end of the road.” Furthermore, we can only make these temporally
abstract plans once we’ve learned how to ride a bike in the first place. As
discussed earlier, we need some way to (1) start the learning using a
trial-and-error approach and (2) provide a mechanism to gradually increase the
level of abstraction that we use to plan. For this, we introduce temporal
difference models.
</p>

<h2 id="temporal-difference-models">Temporal Difference Models</h2>
<p>
  A temporal difference model (TDM)$^\dagger$, which we will write as $Q(s, a, s_g, \tau)$, is a function that, given a state $s \in \mathcal{S}$, action $a \in \mathcal{A}$, and goal state $s_g \in \mathcal{S}$, predicts how close an agent can get to the goal within $\tau$ time steps. Intuitively, a TDM answers the question, “If I try to bike to San Francisco in 30 minutes, how close will I get?” For robotics, a natural way to measure closeness is use Euclidean distance.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tdm/tdm-visualization-small.png" alt="A TDM predicts how close you will get to the goal (Golden Gate Bridge) after a fixed amount of time. After 30 minutes of biking, maybe you only reach the grey biker in the image above. In this case, the grey line represents the distance that the TDM should predict."

fixed amount of time. After 30 minutes of biking, maybe you only reach the grey
biker in the image above. In this case, the grey line represents the distance
that the TDM should predict.
</i>
</p>

<p>
For those familiar with reinforcement learning, it turns out that a TDM can be
viewed as a goal-conditioned Q function in a finite-horizon MDP. Because a TDM
is just another Q function, we can train it with model-free (trial-and-error)
algorithms. We use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971">deep deterministic
policy gradient</a> (DDPG) to train a TDM and retroactively relabel the goal and
time horizon to increase the sample efficiency of our learning algorithm. In
theory, any Q-learning algorithm could be used to train the TDM, but we found
this to be effective. We encourage readers to check out the paper for more
details.
</p>

<h3 id="planning-with-a-tdm">Planning with a TDM</h3>
<p>
Once we train a TDM, how can we use it to plan? It turns out that we can plan with the following optimization:
</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
  \qquad \text{max}_{a_1, a_K, a_{2K}, s_1, s_K, s_{2K}, ..} \sum_{t=1, K, 2K, ...} r(s_t) \text{ subject to } Q(s_t, a_t, s_{t+K}, K) = 0
</script>

<p>
The intuition is similar to the model-based formulation. Choose a sequence of
actions and states that maximize rewards and that are feasible. A key difference
is that we only plan <i>every $K$ time steps</i>, rather than every time step.
The constraint that $Q(s_t, a_t, s_{t+K}, K) = 0$ enforces the feasibility of
the trajectory. Visually, rather than explicitly planning $K$ steps and actions
like so 
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tdm/comp-mb.jpeg" alt="Model based planning many steps." 
width="80%"
/><br />
</p>

<p>
We can instead directly plan over $K$ time steps as shown below:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tdm/comp-tdm.jpeg" alt="TDM planning one step" 
width="80%"
/><br />
</p>

<p>
As we increase $K$, we get temporally more and more abstract plans. In between
the $K$ time steps, we use a model-free approach to take actions, thereby
allowing the model-free policy “abstract away” the details of how the goal is
actually reached. For the biking problem and for large enough values of $K$, the
optimization could result in a plan like:
</p>

width="80%"
/><br />
<i>
A model-based planner can be used to choose temporally abstract goals. A model-free algorithm can be used to reach those goals.
</i>
</p>

<p>
One caveat is that this formulation can only optimize the reward at every $K$
steps. However, many tasks only care about some states, such as the final state
(e.g. “reach the Golden Gate Bridge”) and so this still captures a variety of
interesting tasks.
</p>

<h3 id="related-work">Related Work</h3>
<p>
  We’re not the first to look at the connection between model-based and model-free reinforcement. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/icml08.pdf">Parr ‘08</a> and <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/61d4/897dbf7ced83a0eb830a8de0dd64abb58ebd.pdf">Boyan ‘99</a>, are particularly related, though they focus mainly on tabular and linear function approximators. The idea of training a goal condition Q function was also explored in <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/papers/horde-aamas-11.pdf">Sutton ‘11</a> and <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/schaul15.pdf">Schaul ‘15</a>, in the context of robot navigation and Atari games. Lastly, the relabelling scheme that we use is inspired by the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495">Andrychowicz ‘17</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>
  We tested TDMs on five simulated continuous control tasks and one real-world robotics task. One of the simulated tasks is to train a robot arm to push a cylinder to a target position. An example of the final pushing TDM policy and the associate learning curves are shown below:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>
Left: TDM policy for reaching task. Right: Learning curves. TDM is blue (lower is better).
</i>
</p>

<p>
In the learning curve to the right, we plot the final distance to goal versus
the number of environment samples (lower is better). Our simulation controls the
robots at 20 Hz, meaning that 1000 steps corresponds to 50 seconds in the real
world. The dynamics of this environment are relatively easy to learn, meaning
that a model-based approach should excel. As expected, the model-based
approaches (purple curve) learns quickly--roughly 3000 steps, or 25 minutes--and
performs well. The TDM approach (blue curve) also learn quickly--roughly 2000
steps, or 17 minutes. The model-free DDPG (without TDMs) baseline eventually
solves the task, but requires many more training samples. One reason the TDM
approach learns so quickly is that it effectively is a model-based method in
disguise.
</p>

<p>
The story looks much better for model-free approaches when we move to locomotion
tasks, which have substantially harder dynamics. One of the locomotion tasks
involves training a quadruped robot to move to a certain position. The resulting
TDM policy is shown below on the left, along with the accompanying learning
curve on the right.
</p>

</i>
</p>

<p>
  Just as we use trial-and-error rather than planning to master riding a bicycle, we expect model-free methods to perform better than model-based methods on these locomotion tasks. This is precisely what we see in the learning curve on the right: the model-based method plateaus in performance. The model-free DDPG method learns more slowly, but eventually outperforms the model-based approach. TDM manages to both learn quickly and achieve good final performance. There are more experiments in the paper, including training a real-world 7 degree-of-freedom Sawyer to reach positions. We encourage the readers to check them out!
</p>

<h2 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h2>
<p>
  Temporal difference models provide a formalism and practical algorithm for interpolating from model-free to model-based control. However, there’s a lot of future work to be done. For one, the derivation assumes that the environment and policies are deterministic. In practice, most environments are stochastic. Even if they were deterministic, there are compelling reasons to use a stochastic policy in practice (see <a href="http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/10/06/soft-q-learning/">this blog post</a> for one example). Extending TDMs to this setting would help move TDMs to more realistic environments. Another idea would be to combine TDMs with alternative model-based planning optimization algorithms that the ones we used in the paper.  Lastly, we’d like to apply TDMs to more challenging tasks with real-world robots, like locomotion, manipulation, and, of course, bicycling to the Golden Gate Bridge.
