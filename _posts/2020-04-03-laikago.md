Quadruped robot learning locomotion skills by imitating a dog.
</i>
</p>

Whether it’s a dog chasing after a ball, or a monkey swinging through the
trees, animals can effortlessly perform an incredibly rich repertoire of agile
locomotion skills. But designing controllers that enable legged robots to
replicate these agile behaviors can be a very challenging task. The superior
agility seen in animals, as compared to robots, might lead one to wonder: can
we create more agile robotic controllers with less effort by directly imitating
animals?

In this work, we present a framework for learning robotic locomotion skills by
imitating animals. Given a reference motion clip recorded from an animal (e.g.
a dog), our framework uses reinforcement learning to train a control policy
that enables a robot to imitate the motion in the real world. Then, by simply
providing the system with different reference motions, we are able to train a
quadruped robot to perform a diverse set of agile behaviors, ranging from fast
walking gaits to dynamic hops and turns. The policies are trained primarily in
simulation, and then transferred to the real world using a latent space
adaptation technique, which is able to efficiently adapt a policy using only a
few minutes of data from the real robot.

## Framework

Our framework consists of three main components: motion retargeting, motion
imitation, and domain adaptation. 1) First, given a reference motion, the
motion retargeting stage maps the motion from the original animal’s morphology
to the robot’s morphology. 2) Next, the motion imitation stage uses the
retargeted reference motion to train a policy for imitating the motion in
simulation. 3) Finally, the domain adaptation stage transfers the policy from
simulation to a real robot via a sample efficient domain adaptation process. We
apply this framework to learn a variety of agile locomotion skills for a
<a href="http://www.unitree.cc/e/action/ShowInfo.php?classid=6&id=1">Laikago</a>
quadruped robot.

animal, and outputs a control  policy that enables a robot to reproduce the
motion in the real world.

</p>

### Motion Retargeting

An animal’s body is generally quite different from a robot’s body. So before
the robot can imitate the animal’s motion, we must first map the motion to the
robot’s body. The goal of the retargeting process is to construct a reference
motion for the robot that captures the important characteristics of the
animal’s motion. To do this, we first identify a set of source keypoints on the
animal’s body, such as the hips and the feet. Then, corresponding target
keypoints are specified on the robot’s body.

Inverse-kinematics (IK) is used to retarget mocap clips recorded from a real
dog (left) to the robot (right). Corresponding pairs of keypoints (red) are
specified on the dog and robot’s bodies,  and then IK is used to compute a pose
for the robot that tracks the keypoints.
</i>
</p>

Next, inverse-kinematics is used to construct a reference motion for the robot
that tracks the corresponding keypoints from the animal at every timestep.

### Motion Imitation

After retargeting the reference motion to the robot, the next step is to train
a control policy to imitate the retargeted motion. But reinforcement learning
algorithms can take a long time to learn an effective policy, and directly
training on a real robot can be fairly dangerous (both for the robot and its
human companions). So, we instead opt to perform most of the training in the
comforts of simulation, and then transfer the learned policy to the real world
using more sample efficient adaptation techniques. All simulations are
performed using <a href="https://pybullet.org/">PyBullet</a>.

The policy $\pi(\mathbf{a} | \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{g})$, takes as input a state
$\mathbf{s}$, which represents the configuration of the robot’s body, and a
goal $\mathbf{g}$, which specifies target poses from the reference motion that
the robot is to imitate.  It then outputs an action $\mathbf{a}$, which
specifies target angles for PD controllers at each of the robot’s joints. To
train the policy to imitate a reference motion, we use a reward function that
encourages the robot to minimize the difference between the pose of the
reference motion $\hat{\mathbf{q}}_t$ and the pose of the simulated character
$\mathbf{q}_t$ at every timestep $t$,

$$
r_t = \exp \Big[ - \| \hat{\mathbf{q}}_t - \mathbf{q}_t \|^2 \Big]
$$

By simply using different reference motions in the reward function, we can
train a simulated robot to imitate a variety of different skills.

### Domain Adaptation

Since simulators generally provide only a coarse approximation of the real
world, policies trained in simulation often perform fairly poorly when deployed
on a real robot. Therefore, to transfer a policy trained in simulation to the
real world, we use a sample efficient domain adaptation techniques that can
adapt the policy to the real world using only a small number of trials on the
real robot. To do this, we first apply
<a href="https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/SimToReal/index.html">domain randomization</a> during training in simulation, which randomly varies the
dynamics parameters, such as mass and friction. The dynamics parameters are
then also collected into a vector $\mu$ and encoded into a latent presentation
$\mathbf{z}$ by an encoder $E(\mathbf{z} | \mu)$. The latent encoding  is
passed as an additional input to the policy $\pi(\mathbf{a} | \mathbf{s},
\mathbf{g}, \mathbf{z})$.

<br>
<i>
The dynamics parameters  of the simulation are varied during training, and also
encoded into a latent representation  that is provided as an additional input
to the policy.
</i>
</p>

When transferring the policy to a real robot, we remove the encoder and
directly search for a $\mathbf{z}$ that maximizes the robot’s rewards in the
real world.  This is done using
<a href="https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/AWR/index.html">advantage weighted regression</a>,
a simple off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. In our experiments, this
technique is often able to adapt a policy to the real world with less than 50
trials, which corresponds to roughly 8 minutes of real-world data.

## Results

Our framework is able to train a robot to imitate various locomotion skills
from a dog, including different walking gaits, such as pacing and trotting, as
well as a fast spinning motion. By simply playing the forwards walking motions
backwards, we are also able to train the robot to walk backwards.

In addition to imitating motions from real dogs, we can also imitate
artist-animated keyframe motion, including a dynamic hop-turn:

We also compared the learned policies with the manually-designed controllers
provided by the manufacturer. Our policies are able to learn faster gaits.

</p>

Overall, our system has been able to reproduce a fairly diverse corpus of
behaviors with a quadruped robot. However, due to hardware and algorithmic
limitations, we have not been able to imitate more dynamic motions such as
running and jumping. The learned policies are also not as robust as the best
manually-designed controllers. Exploring techniques for further improving the
agility and robustness of these learned policies could be a valuable step
towards more complex real-world applications. Extending this framework to learn
<a href="https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/SFV/index.html">skills from videos</a>
would also be an exciting direction, which can substantially increase the
volume of data from which robots can learn from.
