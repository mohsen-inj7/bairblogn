Over the last few years we have experienced an enormous data deluge, which has
played a key role in the surge of interest in AI. A partial list of some large
datasets:

- [ImageNet][1], with over 14 million images for classification and object detection.
- [Movielens][2], with 20 million user ratings of movies for collaborative filtering.
- [Udacity's][3] car dataset (at least 223GB) for training self-driving cars.
- [Yahoo's][4] 13.5 TB dataset of user-news interaction for studying human behavior.

[Stochastic Gradient Descent][5] (SGD) has been the engine fueling the
development of large-scale models for these datasets. SGD is remarkably
well-suited to large datasets: it estimates the gradient of the loss function on
a full dataset using only a fixed-sized minibatch, and updates a model many
times with each pass over the dataset.

But SGD has limitations. When we construct a model, we use a loss function
$L_\theta(x)$ with dataset $x$ and model parameters $\theta$ and attempt to
minimize the loss by gradient descent on $\theta$. This shortcut approach makes
optimization easy, but is vulnerable to a variety of problems including
over-fitting, excessively sensitive coefficient values, and possibly slow
convergence. A more robust approach is to treat the inference problem for
$\theta$ as a full-blown posterior inference, deriving a joint distribution
$p(x,\theta)$ from the loss function, and computing the posterior $p(\theta|x)$.
This is the Bayesian modeling approach, and specifically the Bayesian Neural
Network approach when applied to deep models. This recent [tutorial by Zoubin
Ghahramani][6] discusses some of the advantages of this approach.

The model posterior $p(\theta|x)$ for most problems is intractable (no closed
form). There are two methods in Machine Learning to work around intractable
posteriors: [Variational Bayesian methods][7] and [Markov Chain Monte Carlo][8]
(MCMC). In variational methods, the posterior is approximated with a simpler
distribution (e.g. a normal distribution) and its distance to the true posterior
is minimized. In MCMC methods, the posterior is approximated as a sequence of
correlated samples (points or particle densities). Variational Bayes methods
have been widely used but often introduce significant error --- see [this recent
comparison with Gibbs Sampling][9], also [Figure 3 from the Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) paper][10].  Variational methods are also more computationally
expensive than direct parameter SGD (it’s a small constant factor, but a small
constant times 1-10 days can be quite important).

MCMC methods have no such bias. You can think of MCMC particles as rather like
quantum-mechanical particles: you only observe individual instances, but they
follow an arbitrarily-complex joint distribution. By taking multiple samples you
can infer useful statistics, apply regularizing terms, etc. But MCMC methods
have one over-riding problem with respect to large datasets: other than the
important class of conjugate models which admit Gibbs sampling, there has been
no efficient way to do the Metropolis-Hastings tests required by general MCMC
methods on minibatches of data (we will define/review MH tests in a moment). In
response, researchers had to design models to make inference tractable, e.g.
[Restricted Boltzmann Machines][11] (RBMs) use a layered, undirected design to
make Gibbs sampling possible. In a recent breakthrough, [VAEs][10] use
variational methods to support more general posterior distributions in
probabilistic auto-encoders.  But with VAEs, like other variational models, one
has to live with the fact that the model is a best-fit approximation, with
(usually) no quantification of how close the approximation is. Although they
typically offer better accuracy, MCMC methods have been sidelined recently in
auto-encoder applications, lacking an efficient scalable MH test.

<!--more-->

A bridge between SGD and Bayesian modeling has been forged recently by papers on
[Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics][12] (SGLD) and [Stochastic Gradient
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo][13] (SGHMC). These methods involve minor variations to
typical SGD updates which generate samples from a probability distribution which
is approximately the Bayesian model posterior $p(\theta|x)$. These approaches
turn SGD into an MCMC method, and as such require Metropolis-Hastings (MH) tests
for accurate results, the topic of this blog post.

Because of these developments, interest has warmed recently in scalable MCMC and
in particular in doing the MH tests required by general MCMC models on large
datasets. Normally an MH test requires a scan of the full dataset and is applied
each time one wants a data sample. Clearly for large datasets, it’s intractable
to do this. Two papers from ICML 2014, [Korattikara et al.][14] and [Bardenet et
al.][15], attempt to reduce the cost of MH tests. They both use concentration
bounds, and both achieve constant-factor improvements relative to a full dataset
scan. [Other recent work][16] improves performance but makes even stronger
assumptions about the model which limits applicability, especially for deep
networks. None of these approaches come close to matching the performance of
SGD, i.e.  generating a posterior sample from small constant-size batches of
data.

In this post we describe a new approach to MH testing which moves the cost of MH
testing from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ relative to dataset size. It avoids the need for
global statistics and does not use tail bounds (which lead to long-tailed
distributions for the amount of data required for a test). Instead we use a
novel correction distribution to directly “morph” the distribution of a noisy
minibatch estimator into a smooth MH test distribution. Our method is a true
“black-box” method which provides estimates on the accuracy of each MH test
using only data from a small expected size minibatch. It can even be applied to
unbounded data streams. It can be “piggy-backed” on existing SGD implementations
to provide full posterior samples (via SGLD or SGHMC) for almost the same cost
as SGD samples. Thus full Bayesian neural network modeling is now possible for
about the same cost as SGD optimization. Our approach is also a potential
substitute for variational methods and VAEs, providing unbiased posterior
samples at lower cost.

To explain the approach, we review the role of MH tests in MCMC models.

# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Review

## Markov Chains

MCMC methods are designed to sample from a target distribution which is
difficult to compute. To generate samples, they utilize Markov Chains, which
consist of nodes representing states of the system and probability distributions
for transitioning from one state to another.

A key concept is the *Markovian assumption*, which states that the probability
of being in a state at time $t+1$ can be inferred entirely based on the current
state at time $t$.  Mathematically, letting $\theta_t$ represent the current
state of the Markov chain at time $t$, we have $p(\theta_{t+1} | \theta_t,
\ldots, \theta_0) = p(\theta_{t+1} | \theta_t)$. By using these probability
distributions, we can generate a *chain of samples* $(\theta_i)_{i=1}^T$ for
some large $T$.

Since the probability of being in state $\theta_{t+1}$ directly depends on
$\theta_t$, the samples are *correlated*. Rather surprisingly, it can be shown
that, under mild assumptions, in the limit of many samples the distribution of
the chain's samples approximates the target distribution.

A full review of MCMC methods is beyond the scope of this post, but a good
reference is the [Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (2011)][17]. Standard
machine learning textbooks such as [Koller & Friedman (2009)][18] and [Murphy
(2012)][19] also cover MCMC methods.

## Metropolis-Hastings

One of the most general and powerful MCMC methods is
[**Metropolis-Hastings**][20].  This uses a test to *filter* samples. To define
it properly, let $p(\theta)$ be the *target distribution* we want to
approximate. In general, it's intractable to sample directly from it.
Metropolis-Hastings uses a simpler *proposal distribution* $q(\theta' | \theta)$
to generate samples. Here, $\theta$ represents our *current* sample in the
chain, and $\theta'$ represents the proposed sample. For simple cases, it's
common to use a Gaussian proposal centered at $\theta$.

If we were to just use a Gaussian to generate samples in our chain, there's no
way we could approximate our target $p$, since the samples would form a random
walk. The MH test cleverly resolves this by *filtering* samples with the
following test. Draw a uniform random variable $u \in [0,1]$ and determine
whether the following is true:

$$
u \;{\overset{?}{<}}\; \min\left\{\frac{p(\theta')q(\theta | \theta')}{p(\theta)q(\theta' | \theta)}, 1\right\}
$$

If true, we *accept* $\theta'$. Otherwise, we *reject and reuse* the old sample
$\theta$. Notice that

- It doesn't require knowledge of a normalizing constant (independent of
  $\theta$ and $\theta'$), because that cancels out in the
  $p(\theta')/p(\theta)$ ratio. This is great, because normalizing constants are
  arguably the biggest reason why distributions become intractable.
- The higher the value of $p(\theta')$, the more likely we are to accept.

To get more intuition on how the test works, we've created the following figure
from [this Jupyter Notebook][21], showing the progression of samples to
approximate a target posterior. This example is derived from [Welling & Teh
(2011)][12].

<p style="text-align:center;">

A quick example of the MH test in action on a mixture of Gaussians example. The
parameter is $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^2$ with the x and y axes representing
$\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, respectively. The target posterior has contours shown
in the fourth plot; the probability mass is concentrated in the diagonal between
points $(0,1)$ and $(1,-1)$. (This posterior depends on sampled Gaussians.) The
plots show the progression of the MH test after 50, 500, and 5000 samples in our
MCMC chain. After 5000 samples, it's clear that our samples are concentrated in
the regions with higher posterior probability.

# Reducing Metropolis-Hastings Data Usage

What happens when we consider the Bayesian posterior inference case with large
datasets? (Perhaps we're interested in the same example in the figure above,
except that the posterior is based on more data points.) Then our goal is to
sample to approximate the distribution $p(\theta | x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ for large
$N$. By Bayes' rule, this is $\frac{p_0(\theta)p(x_1, \ldots, x_N | \theta)
}{p(x_1,\ldots,x_N)}$ where $p_0$ is the prior. We additionally assume that the
$x_i$ are conditionally independent given $\theta$. The MH test therefore
becomes:

$$
u \;{\overset{?}{<}}\; \min\left\{\frac{p_0(\theta')\prod_{i=1}^Np(x_i|\theta') q(\theta |
\theta')}{p_0(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^Np(x_i|\theta) q(\theta' | \theta)}, 1\right\}
$$

Or, after taking logarithms and rearranging (while ignoring the minimum
operator, which technically isn't needed here), we get

$$
\log\left(u\frac{q(\theta'|\theta)p_0(\theta)}{q(\theta|\theta')p_0(\theta')}\right)
\;{\overset{?}{<}}\;
\sum_{i=1}^N \log\frac{p(x_i|\theta')}{p(x_i|\theta)}
$$

The problem now is apparent: it's expensive to compute all the $p(x_i |
\theta')$ terms, and this has to be done *every time we sample* since it depends
on $\theta'$.

The naive way to deal with this is to apply the same test, but with a minibatch
of $b$ elements:

$$
\log\left(u\frac{q(\theta'|\theta)p_0(\theta)}{q(\theta|\theta')p_0(\theta')}\right)
\;{\overset{?}{<}}\;
\frac{N}{b} \sum_{i=1}^b \log\frac{p(x_i^*|\theta')}{p(x_i^*|\theta)}
$$

Unfortunately, this won't sample from the correct target distribution; see
Section 6.1 in [Bardenet et al. (2017)][16] for details.

A better strategy is to start with the same batch of $b$ points, but then gauge
the *confidence* of the batch test relative to using the full data. If, after
seeing $b$ points, we already know that our proposed sample $\theta'$ is
significantly worse than our current sample $\theta$, then we should reject
right away. If $\theta'$ is significantly better, we should accept. If it's
ambiguous, then we increase the size of our test batch, perhaps to $2b$
elements, and then measure the test's confidence. Lather, rinse, repeat. As
mentioned earlier, [Korattikara et al. (2014)][14] and [Bardenet et al.
(2014)][15] developed algorithms following this framework.

A weakness of the above approach is that it’s doing repeated testing and one
must reduce the allowable test error each time one increments the test batch
size. Unfortunately, there is also a significant probability that the approaches
above will grow the test batch all the way to the full dataset, and they offer
at most constant factor speedups over testing the full dataset.

# Minibatch Metropolis-Hastings: Our Contribution

## Change the Acceptance Function

To set up our test, we first define the log transition probability ratio
$\Delta$:

$$
\Delta(\theta,\theta') = \log \frac{p_0(\theta')\prod_{i=1}^N p(x_i |
\theta')q(\theta | \theta')}{p_0(\theta)\prod_{i=1}^N p(x_i | \theta)q(\theta' |
\theta)}
$$

This log ratio factors into a sum of per-sample terms, so when we approximate
its value by computing on a minibatch we get an unbiased estimator of its
full-data value plus some noise (which is asymptotically normal by the Central
Limit Theorem).

The first step for applying our MH test is to use a different acceptance
function. Expressed in terms of $\Delta$, the classical MH accepts a transition
with probability given by the blue curve.

Given current sample $\theta$ and proposed sample $\theta'$, the vertical axis
represents the probability of accepting $\theta'$.
</i>
</p>

Instead of using the classical test, we'll use the sigmoid function. It might
not be apparent why this is allowed, but there's some elegant theory that
explains why using this alternative function *as the acceptance test for MH*
still results in the correct semantics of MCMC. That is, under the same mild
assumptions, the distribution of samples $(\theta_i)_{i=1}^T$ approaches the
target distribution.

along with the equivalent MH test expression ($X_{\rm log}+\Delta > 0$) with the
sigmoid acceptance function.
</i>
</p>

Our acceptance test is now the sigmoid function. Note that the sigmoid function
is the *cumulative distribution function* of a (standard) [Logistic random
variable][23]; the figure above plots the density. One can show that the MH test
under the sigmoid acceptance function reduces to determining whether $X_{\rm
\log} + \Delta > 0$ for a sampled $X_{\rm log}$ value.

## New MH Test

This is nice, but we don't want to compute $\Delta$ because it depends on all
$p(x_i | \theta')$ terms. When we estimate $\Delta$ using a minibatch, we
introduce an additive error which is approximately normal, $X_{\rm normal}$.  The
key observation in our work is that the distribution of the minibatch estimate
of $\Delta$ (approximately Gaussian) is already very close to the desired test
distribution $X_{\rm log}$, as shown below.

curve, colored in lime, which corresponds to a standard deviation of 1.7.
</i>
</p>

Rather than resorting to tail bounds as in prior work, we directly bridge these
two distributions using an additive correction variable $X_{\rm correction}$:

<p style="text-align:center;">

alt="test_visual"><br>
<i>
A diagram of our minibatch MH test. On the right we have the full data test that
we want, but we can't use it since $\Delta$ is intractable.  Instead, we have
$\Delta + X_{\rm normal}$ (from the left side) and must add a correction $X_{\rm
correction}$.
</i>
</p>

We want to make the LHS and RHS distributions equal, so we add in a correction
$X_{\rm correction}$ which is a symmetric random variable centered at zero.
Adding independent random variables gives a random variable whose distribution
is the convolution of the summands’ distributions. So finding the correction
distribution involves “deconvolution” of a logistic and normal distribution.
It’s not always possible to do this, and several conditions must be met (e.g.
the tails of the normal distribution must be weaker than the logistic) but
luckily for us they are. [In our paper][22] to appear at UAI 2017 we show that
the correction distribution can be approximated to essentially single-precision
floating-point precision by tabulation.

In our paper, we also prove theoretical results bounding the error of our test,
and present experimental results showing that our method results in accurate
posterior estimation for a Gaussian Mixture Model, and that it is also highly
sample-efficient in Logistic Regression for classification of MNIST digits.

each iteration. Note the log-log scale of the histograms.

We hope our test is useful to other researchers who are looking to use MCMC
methods in large datasets. We've also [implemented an open-source version of the
test][24] as part of the [BIDMach machine learning library][25] developed at UC
Berkeley.
