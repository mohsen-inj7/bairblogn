Learning a new skill by observing another individual, the ability to imitate, is
a key part of intelligence in human and animals. Can we enable a robot to do the
same, learning to manipulate a new object by simply watching a human
manipulating the object just as in the video below?

Such a capability would make it dramatically easier for us to communicate new
goals to robots -- we could simply *show* robots what we want them to do, rather
than teleoperating the robot or engineering a reward function (an approach that
is difficult as it requires a full-fledged perception system). Many prior works
have investigated how well a robot can learn from an expert of its own kind
(i.e. through [teleoperation][1] or [kinesthetic teaching][2]), which is usually
called *[imitation learning][3]*. However, imitation learning of vision-based
skills usually requires a huge number of demonstrations of an expert performing
a skill. For example, a task like reaching toward a single fixed object using
raw pixel input requires 200 demonstrations to achieve good performance
according to [this prior work][1]. Hence a robot will struggle if there’s only
one demonstration presented.

Moreover, the problem becomes even more challenging when the robot needs to
imitate a human showing a certain manipulation skill. First, the robot arm looks
significantly different from the human arm. Second, engineering the right
correspondence between human demonstrations and robot demonstrations is
unfortunately extremely difficult. It's not enough simple to track and remap the
motion: the task depends much more critically on how this motion affects objects
in the world, and we need a correspondence that is centrally based on the
interaction.

To enable the robot to imitate skills from one video of a human, we can allow it
to incorporate prior experience, rather than learn each skill completely from
scratch. By incorporating prior experience, the robot should also be able to
quickly learn to manipulate new objects while being invariant to shifts in
domain, such as a person providing a demonstration, a varying background scene,
or different viewpoint. We aim to achieve both of these abilities, few-shot
imitation and domain invariance, by learning to learn from demonstration data.
The technique, also called meta-learning and discussed in [this previous blog
post][4], is the key to how we equip robots with the ability to imitate by
observing a human.

# One-Shot Imitation Learning

So how can we use meta-learning to make a robot quickly adapt to many different
objects? Our approach is to combine meta-learning with imitation learning to
enable one-shot imitation learning. The core idea is that provided a single
demonstration of a particular task, i.e. maneuvering a certain object, the robot
can quickly identify what the task is and successfully solve it under different
circumstances. [A prior work][5] on one-shot imitation learning achieves
impressive results on simulated tasks such as block-stacking by learning to
learn across tens of thousands of demonstrations. If we want a physical robot to
able to emulate humans and manipulate a variety of novel objects, we need to
develop a new system that can learn to learn from demonstrations in the form of
videos using a dataset that can be practically collected in the real world.
First, we’ll discuss our approach for visual imitation of a single demonstration
collected via teleoperation. Then, we’ll show how it can be extended for
learning from videos of humans.

## One-Shot Visual Imitation Learning

In order to make robots able to learn from watching videos, we combine imitation
learning with an efficient meta-learning algorithm, [model-agnostic
meta-learning][6] (MAML). [This previous blog post][4] gives a nice overview of
the MAML algorithm. In this approach, we use a standard convolutional neural
network with parameters $\theta$ as our policy representation, mapping from an
image $o_t$ from the robot’s camera and the robot configuration $x_t$ (e.g.
joint angles and joint velocities) to robot actions $a_t$ (e.g. the linear and
angular velocity of the gripper) at time step $t$.

There are three main steps in this algorithm.

<i>

</i>
</p>

First, we collected a large dataset containing demonstrations of a teleoperated robot
performing many different tasks, which in our case, corresponds to manipulating
different objects. During the second step, we use MAML to learn an initial set
of policy parameters $\theta$, such that, after being provided a demonstration
for a certain object, we can run gradient descent with respect to the
demonstration to find a generalizable policy with parameters $\theta’$ for that
object. When using teleoperated demonstrations, the policy updates can be
computed by comparing the policy’s predicted action $\pi_\theta(o_t)$ to the
expert action $$a^*_t$$: 

$$\theta’ \leftarrow \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \sum_t || \pi_\theta(o_t) -
a^*_t || ^2.$$ 

Then, we optimize for the initial parameters $\theta$ by driving the updated
policy $$\pi_{\theta’}$$ to match the actions from another demonstration with
the same object. After meta-training, we can ask the robot to manipulate
completely unseen objects by computing gradient steps using a single
demonstration of that task. This step is called meta-testing.

As the method does not introduce any additional parameters for meta-learning and
optimization, it turns out to be quite data-efficient. Hence it can perform
various control tasks such as pushing and placing by just watching a
teleoperated robot demonstration:

## One-Shot Imitation from Observing Humans via Domain-Adaptive Meta-Learning

The above method still relies on demonstrations coming from a teleoperated robot
rather than a human. To this end, we designed a domain-adaptive one-shot
imitation approach building on the above algorithm. We collected demonstrations
of many different tasks performed by both teleoperated robots *and* humans. Then, we
provide the human demonstration for computing the policy update and evaluate the
updated policy using a robot demonstration performing the same task. A diagram
illustrating this algorithm is below:

<i>

</i>
</p>

Unfortunately, as a human demonstration is just a video of a human performing
the task, which doesn’t contain the expert actions $$a^*_t$$, we can’t calculate
the policy update defined above. Instead, we propose to *learn* a loss function
for updating the policy, a loss function that doesn’t require action labels. The
intuition behind learning a loss function is that we can acquire a function that
only uses the available inputs, the unlabeled video, while still producing
gradients that are suitable for updating the policy parameters in a way that
produces a successful policy. While this might seem like an impossible task, it
is important to remember that the meta-training process still supervises the
policy with true robot actions after the gradient step.  The role of the learned
loss therefore may be interpreted as simply directing the parameter update to
modify the policy to pick up on the right visual cues in the scene, so that the
meta-trained action output will produce the right actions. We represent the
learned loss function using temporal convolutions, which can extract temporal
information in the video demonstration:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/daml/temporal_conv.png" width="600"><br>
</p>

We refer to this method as domain-adaptive meta-learning algorithm, as it learns
from data (e.g. videos of humans) from a different domain as the domain that the
robot’s policy operates in. Our method enables a PR2 robot to effectively learn
to push many different objects that are unseen during meta-training toward
target positions:

and pick up many objects and place them onto target containers by watching a
human manipulates each object:

We also evaluated the method using human demonstrations collected in a different
room with a different camera. The robot still performs these tasks reasonably
well:

# What’s Next?

Now that we’ve taught a robot to learn to manipulate new objects by watching a
single video (which we also [demonstrated at NIPS 2017][7]), a natural next step
is to further scale these approaches to the setting where different tasks
correspond to entirely distinct motions and objectives, such as using a wide
variety of tools or playing a wide variety of sports. By considering
significantly more diversity in the underlying distribution of tasks, we hope
that these models will be able to achieve broader generalization, allowing
robots to quickly develop strategies for new situations. Further, the techniques
we developed here are not specific to robotic manipulation or even control. For
instance, both imitation learning and meta-learning have been used in the
context of language (examples [here][8] and [here][9] respectively). In language
and other sequential decision-making settings, learning to imitate from a few
demonstrations is an interesting direction for future work.
