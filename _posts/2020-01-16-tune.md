In this blog post, we share our experiences in developing two critical software
libraries that many [BAIR][1] researchers use to execute large-scale AI
experiments: [Ray Tune][2] and the [Ray Cluster Launcher][3], both of which now
back many popular open-source AI libraries.

As AI research becomes more compute intensive, many AI researchers have become
squeezed for time and resources. Many researchers now rely on cloud providers
like Amazon Web Services or Google Compute Platform to access the huge amounts
of computational resources necessary for training large models.

# Understanding research infrastructure

To put things into perspective, let’s first take a look at a standard machine
learning workflow in industry (Figure 1).

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>

The typical *research* workflow is actually a tight loop between steps 2 and 3, generalizing to something like
Figure 2.

for <b>research</b>. The research workflow is typically a subsection of the
industry workflow.

</p>

The research workflow is very much an iterative process and is often bottlenecked by
the *experiment execution* step (Figure 2, B). Typically, an “experiment”
consists of multiple training jobs, or “trials”, where each trial is a job that
trains a single model. Each trial might train a model using a different set of
configuration parameters (hyperparameters) or a different seed.

At Berkeley, we saw that AI researchers moving to the cloud spent a lot of time
writing their own experiment execution tools that wrangled cloud-provider APIs
for starting instances, setting up dependencies, and launching experiments.

Unfortunately, despite the vast amounts of time poured into developing these
tools, these ad-hoc solutions are typically limited in functionality:

- **Simplistic Architecture**: Each trial is typically launched on a separate
  node without any centralized control logic. This makes it difficult for
  researchers to implement optimization techniques such as [Population-based
  Training][5] or [Bayesian Optimization][6] that require coordination between
  different runs.

- **Lack of Fault Handling**: The results of training jobs are lost forever if
  an instance fails. Researchers often manually manage the failover by tracking
  live experiments on a spreadsheet, but this is both time consuming and
  error-prone.

- **No Spot Instance Discount**: The lack of fault tolerance capabilities also
  means forgoing the spot instance discount ([up to 90][4]%) that cloud
  providers offer.

To sum up, instrumenting and managing distributed experiments on cloud
resources is both burdensome and difficult to get right. As such, easy-to-use
frameworks that bridge the gap between execution and research can greatly
accelerate the research process. Members from a couple of labs across BAIR
collaborated to build two complementary tools for AI experimentation in the
cloud:

[Ray Tune][2]: a fault-tolerant framework for training and hyperparameter
tuning. Specifically, Ray Tune (or “Tune” for short):

1. Coordinates among parallel jobs to enable **parallel hyperparameter optimization**.
2. **Automatically checkpoints and resumes** training jobs in case of machine failures.
3. Offers many state-of-the-art hyperparameter search algorithms such as
[Population-based Training and HyperBand][25].

[Ray Cluster Launcher][3]: a utility for managing resource provisioning and
cluster configurations across AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes.

# Ray Tune

Tune was built to address the shortcomings of these ad-hoc experiment execution
tools. This was done by leveraging the **Ray Actor API** and adding **failure
handling**.

## Actor-based Training

Many techniques for hyperparameter optimization
require a framework that monitors the metrics of all concurrent training jobs
and controls the training execution. To address this, Tune uses a master-worker
architecture to centralize decision-making and communicates with its
distributed workers using the Ray Actor API.

*What is the Ray Actor API?* Ray [provides an API][7] to create an “actor” from a Python
class. This enables classes and objects to be used in parallel and distributed
settings.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tune/tune-arch-simple.png" width="500">
<br />
<i>
</i>
</p>

Tune uses a *[Trainable][8]* class interface to define an actor class
specifically for training models. This interface exposes methods such as
`_train`, `_stop`, `_save`, and `_restore`, which allows Tune to monitor
intermediate training metrics and kill low-performing trials.

```python
class NewTrainable(tune.Trainable):
    def _setup(self, config):
        ...

    def _train(self):
        """Run 1 step of training (e.g., one epoch).

        Returns:
            A dict of training metrics.
        """
        ...

    def _save(self, checkpoint_dir):
        ...

    def _restore(self, checkpoint_path):
        ...
```

More importantly, by leveraging the Actor API, we can implement parallel
hyperparameter optimization methods in Tune such as [HyperBand][9] and Parallel
Bayesian Optimization which was not possible with prior experiment execution
tools that researchers used.

## Fault Tolerance

Cloud providers often offer “preemptible instances” (i.e.,
spot instances) at a significant discount. The steep discounts allow
researchers to lower their cloud computing costs significantly. However, the
downside is that the cloud provider can terminate or stop your machine at any
time, causing you to lose training progress.

To enable spot instance usage, we built Tune to automatically checkpoint and
resume training jobs across different machines in the cluster so that
experiments would be resilient to preemption and cluster resizing.

```python
# Tune will resume training jobs from the last checkpoint
# even if machines are removed.

analysis = tune.run(
    NewTrainable,
    checkpoint_freq=5,  # Checkpoint every 5 epochs
    config={"lr": tune.grid_search([0.001, 0.01, 0.1])},
)
```

### How does it work?


<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tune/tune-ft-graphic.jpg" width="700">
<br />
</p>

If a node is lost while a training job is still executing
on that node and a checkpoint of the training job (trial) exists, Tune will
wait until available resources are available to begin executing the trial
again.

If the trial is placed on a different node, Tune will automatically push the
previous checkpoint file to that node and restore the state, allowing the trial
to resume from the latest checkpoint *even after failure*.

# Ray Cluster Launcher

Above, we described the pains of wrangling cloud-provider APIs to automate the
cluster setup process. However, even with a tool for spinning up clusters,
researchers still have to go through a tedious workflow to run experiments:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tune/training-experiment-steps.png" width="700">
<br />
<i>
</i>
</p>

To simplify this, we built the Ray Cluster Launcher, a tool [for provisioning
and autoscaling resources][10] and starting a Ray cluster on AWS EC2, GCP, and
Kubernetes. We then abstracted all of the above steps for running an experiment
into *just a short configuration file and a single command*:

```yaml
# CLUSTER.yaml
cluster_name: tune-default
provider: {type: aws, region: us-west-2}
auth: {ssh_user: ubuntu}
min_workers: 0
max_workers: 2
# Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 21.0
head_node: {
    InstanceType: c4.2xlarge,
    ImageId: ami-0b294f219d14e6a82}
worker_nodes: {
    InstanceType: c4.2xlarge,
    ImageId: ami-0b294f219d14e6a82}
setup_commands: # Set up each node.
    - pip install ray numpy pandas
file_mounts: {
  '/home/ubuntu/files':'my_files/',
}
```
The below command starts a cluster, uploads and runs a script for distributed
hyperparameter tuning, then shuts down the cluster.
```bash
$ ray submit CLUSTER.yaml --start --stop tune_experiment.py \
     --args="--address=auto"
```

Researchers are now using both Ray Tune and the Ray Cluster Launcher to launch
hundreds of parallel jobs at once across dozens of GPU machines at once. [The
Ray Tune documentation page for distributed experiments][11] shows you how you
can do this too.

# Putting things together

Over the last year, we’ve been working with different groups across BAIR to
better allow researchers to leverage the cloud. We had to make Ray Tune and the
Ray Cluster Launcher general enough to support a large body of research
codebases while making the barrier to entry so low that anyone could try it out
in a couple of minutes.

```python
# An example Ray Tune script for PyTorch.
import torch.optim as optim
from ray import tune
from ray.tune.examples.mnist_pytorch import (
    get_data_loaders, ConvNet, train, test)

class TrainMNIST(tune.Trainable):
    def _setup(self, config):
        self.train_loader, self.test_loader = get_data_loaders()
        self.model = ConvNet()
        self.optimizer = optim.SGD(
            self.model.parameters(), lr=config.get("lr", 0.01))

    def _train(self):
        train(self.model, self.optimizer, self.train_loader)
        acc = test(self.model, self.test_loader)
        return {"mean_accuracy": acc}

    def _save(self, checkpoint_dir):
        checkpoint_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "model.pth")
        torch.save(self.model.state_dict(), checkpoint_path)
        return checkpoint_path

    def _restore(self, checkpoint_path):
        self.model.load_state_dict(torch.load(checkpoint_path))

analysis = tune.run(
    TrainMNIST,
    stop={"training_iteration": 50},
    config={"lr": tune.grid_search([0.001, 0.01, 0.1])})

print("Best hyperparameters: ", analysis.get_best_config(
    metric="mean_accuracy"))
# Get a dataframe for analyzing trial results.
df = analysis.dataframe()
```

Tune has grown to become a popular open-source project for hyperparameter
tuning. It is used in many other popular research projects, ranging from
[Population-based Data Augmentation][22], to
[Hyperparameter Tuning for AllenNLP][23], to [AutoML in AnalyticsZoo][24].

Numerous open-source research projects from BAIR now rely on the combination of
Ray Tune and the Ray Cluster Launcher to orchestrate and execute distributed
experiments, including [rail-berkeley/softlearning][21],
[HumanCompatibleAI/adversarial-policies][20], and [flow-project/flow][19].

So go ahead and [try Ray Tune and Cluster Launcher yourself][11]!
