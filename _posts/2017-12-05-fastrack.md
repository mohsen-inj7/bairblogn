# The Problem: Fast and Safe Motion Planning

Real time autonomous motion planning and navigation is hard, especially when we
care about safety.  This becomes even more difficult when we have systems with
complicated dynamics, external disturbances (like wind), and *a priori* unknown
environments. Our goal in this work is to “robustify” existing real-time motion
planners to guarantee safety during navigation of dynamic systems.

<!--more-->

In control theory there are techniques like [Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability
Analysis][1] that provide rigorous safety guarantees of system behavior, along
with an optimal controller to reach a given goal (see Fig. 1). However, in
general the computational methods used in HJ Reachability Analysis are only
tractable in decomposable and/or low-dimensional systems; this is due to the
“curse of dimensionality.”  That means for real time planning we can’t process
safe trajectories for systems of more than about two dimensions. Since most
real-world system models like cars, planes, and quadrotors have more than two
dimensions, these methods are usually intractable in real time.

On the other hand, geometric motion planners like rapidly-exploring random trees
(RRT) and model-predictive control (MPC) can plan in real time by using
simplified models of system dynamics and/or a short planning horizon. Although
this allows us to perform real time motion planning, the resulting trajectories
may be overly simplified, lead to unavoidable collisions, and may even be
dynamically infeasible (see Fig. 1).  For example, imagine riding a bike and
following the path on the ground traced by a pedestrian. This path leads you
straight towards a tree and then takes a 90 degree turn away at the last second.
You can’t make such a sharp turn on your bike, and instead you end up crashing
into the tree. Classically, roboticists have mitigated this issue by pretending
obstacles are slightly larger than they really are during planning.  This
greatly improves the chances of not crashing, but still doesn’t provide
guarantees and may lead to unanticipated collisions.

So how do we combine the speed of fast planning with the safety guarantee of
slow planning?

Figure 1. On the left we have a high-dimensional vehicle moving through an
obstacle course to a goal. Computing the optimal safe trajectory is a slow and
sometimes intractable task, and replanning is nearly impossible.  On the right
we simplify our model of the vehicle (in this case assuming it can move in
straight lines connected at points).  This allows us to plan very quickly, but
when we execute the planned trajectory we may find that we cannot actually
follow the path exactly, and end up crashing.

# The Solution: FaSTrack

FaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking, is a tool that essentially “robustifies” fast
motion planners like RRT or MPC while maintaining real time performance.
FaSTrack allows users to implement a fast motion planner with simplified
dynamics while maintaining safety in the form of a *precomputed* bound on the
maximum possible distance between the planner’s state and the actual autonomous
system’s state at runtime. We call this distance the *tracking error bound*.
This precomputation also results in an optimal control lookup table which
provides the optimal error-feedback controller for the autonomous system to
pursue the online planner in real time.

<i>
Figure 2. The idea behind FaSTrack is to plan using the simplified model (blue),
but precompute a tracking error bound that captures all potential deviations of
the trajectory due to model mismatch and environmental disturbances like wind,
and an error-feedback controller to stay within this bound.  We can then augment
our obstacles by the tracking error bound, which guarantees that our dynamic
system (red) remains safe. Augmenting obstacles is not a new idea in the
robotics community, but by using our tracking error bound we can take into
account system dynamics and disturbances.

## Offline Precomputation

We precompute this tracking error bound by viewing the problem as a
pursuit-evasion game between a planner and a tracker.  The planner uses a
simplified model of the true autonomous system that is necessary for real time
planning; the tracker uses a more accurate model of the true autonomous system.
We assume that the tracker --- the true autonomous system --- is always pursuing
the planner. We want to know what the maximum relative distance (i.e. *maximum
tracking error*) could be in the worst case scenario: when the planner is
actively attempting to evade the tracker.  If we have an upper limit on this
bound then we know the maximum tracking error that can occur at run time.

</p>

Because we care about maximum tracking error, we care about maximum relative
distance.  So to solve this pursuit-evasion game we must first determine the
relative dynamics between the two systems by fixing the planner at the origin
and determining the dynamics of the tracker relative to the planner. We then
specify a cost function as the distance to this origin, i.e. relative distance
of tracker to the planner, as seen in Fig. 4.  The tracker will try to minimize
this cost, and the planner will try to maximize it.  While evolving these
optimal trajectories over time, we capture the highest cost that occurs over the
time period.  If the tracker can always eventually catch up to the planner, this
cost converges to a fixed cost for all time.

The smallest invariant level set of the converged value function provides
determines the tracking error bound, as seen in Fig. 5.  Moreover, the gradient
of the converged value function can be used to create an optimal error-feedback
control policy for the tracker to pursue the planner.  We used [Ian Mitchell's
Level Set Toolbox][2]  and Reachability Analysis to solve this differential
game.  For a more thorough explanation of the optimization, please see [our
recent paper from the 2017 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control][3].

Figures 4 & 5: On the left we show the value function initializing at the cost
function (distance to origin) and evolving according to the differential game.
On the right we should 3D and 2D slices of this value function. Each slice can
be thought of as a “candidate tracking error bound.”  Over time, some of these
bounds become infeasible to stay within. The smallest invariant level set of the
converged value function provides us with the tightest tracking error bound that
is feasible.

## Online real time Planning

In the online phase, we sense obstacles within a given sensing radius and
imagine expanding these obstacles by the tracking error bound with a Minkowski
sum. Using these padded obstacles, the motion planner decides its next desired
state.  Based on that relative state between the tracker and planner, the
optimal control for the tracker (autonomous system) is determined from the
lookup table.  The autonomous system executes the optimal control, and the
process repeats until the goal has been reached.  This means that the motion
planner can continue to plan quickly, and by simply augmenting obstacles and
using a lookup table for control we can ensure safety!

obstacles are discovered (turning red), the RRT plans a new path towards the
goal. Based on the relative state between the planner and the autonomous system,
the optimal control can be found via look-up table.  Even when the RRT planner
makes sudden turns, we are guaranteed to stay within the tracking error bound
(blue box).

# Reducing Conservativeness through Meta-Planning

One consequence of formulating the safe tracking problem as a pursuit-evasion
game between the planner and the tracker is that the resulting safe tracking
bound is often rather conservative. That is, the tracker can’t *guarantee* that
it will be close to the planner if the planner is always allowed to do the
*worst possible behavior*. One solution is to use multiple planning models, each
with its own tracking error bound, simultaneously at planning time. The
resulting “meta-plan” is comprised of trajectory segments computed by each
planner, each labelled with the appropriate optimal controller to track
trajectories generated by that planner. This is illustrated in Fig. 7, where the
large blue error bound corresponds to a planner which is allowed to move very
quickly and the small red bound corresponds to a planner which moves more
slowly.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/fastrack/Figure7.png" width="500" alt="fig7">
<br>
<i>
Figure 7. By considering two different planners, each with a different tracking
error bound, our algorithm is able to find a guaranteed safe “meta-plan” that
prefers the less precise but faster-moving blue planner but reverts to the more
precise but slower red planner in the vicinity of obstacles.  This leads to
natural, intuitive behavior that optimally trades off planner conservatism with
vehicle maneuvering speed.

## Safe Switching

The key to making this work is to ensure that all transitions between planners
are safe. This can get a little complicated, but the main idea is that a
transition between two planners --- call them A and B --- is safe if we can
guarantee that the invariant set computed for A is contained within that for B.
For many pairs of planners this is true, e.g. switching from the blue bound to
the red bound in Fig. 7. But often it is not. In general, we need to solve a
dynamic game very similar to the original one in FaSTrack, but where we want to
know the set of states that we will never leave and from which we can guarantee
we end up inside B’s invariant set. Usually, the resulting *safe switching
bound* (SSB) is slightly larger than A’s tracking error bound (TEB), as shown
below.

Figure 8. The safe switching bound for a transition between a planner with a
large tracking error bound to one with a small tracking error bound is generally
larger than the large tracking error bound, as shown.

## Efficient Online Meta-Planning

To do this efficiently in real time, we use a modified version of the classical
RRT algorithm. Usually, RRTs work by sampling points in state space and
connecting them with line segments to form a tree rooted at the start point. In
our case, we replace the line segments with the actual trajectories generated by
individual planners. In order to find the shortest route to the goal, we favor
planners that can move more quickly, trying them first and only resorting to
slower-moving planners if the faster ones fail.

We do have to be careful to ensure safe switching bounds are satisfied, however.
This is especially important in cases where the meta-planner decides to
transition to a more precise, slower-moving planner, as in the example above. In
such cases, we implement a one-step virtual backtracking algorithm in which we
make sure the preceding trajectory segment is collision-free using the switching
controller.

# Implementation

We implemented both FaSTrack and Meta-Planning in C++ / ROS, using low-level
motion planners from the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL). Simulated results
are shown below, with (right) and without (left) our optimal controller. As you
can see, simply using a linear feedback (LQR) controller (left) provides no
guarantees about staying inside the tracking error bound.

within the tracking error bound. (Right) The optimal tracking controller keeps
the quadrotor within the tracking bound, even during radical changes in the
planned trajectory.

It also works on hardware! We tested on the open-source Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor
platform. As you can see in Fig. 12, we manage to stay inside the tracking bound
at all times, even when switching planners.
