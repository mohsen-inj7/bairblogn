This is a test, based on "Off the Convex Path."

To add a post, make a new markdown file in the `_posts` directory. For
formatting and other guides, [see the Jekyll instructions][1].

To preview locally, run `jekyll build; jekyll serve` and paste the link (it
should be `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`) provided into your web browser. If you
update your post while this is running and refresh the web browser, it should
update.

To put this on the BAIR website, I think we'll generate the site locally, then
securely copy the `_site` folder over to Anca's folder where the BAIR website
lives. Fortunately, Jane and I have permissions to push files there.
