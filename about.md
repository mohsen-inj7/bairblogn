## Overview and Blog Purpose

Besides writing papers and obtaining state-of-the-art results, part of our
scientific mission is to disseminate our results to the public at large. In
recent years, scientific blogs have attracted a large number of views for
technically advanced audiences as a way of disseminating perspectives on recent
results and overall perspectives on the field. However, the most popular blogs
in this area are dominated by large industrial labs.

We hope to address this gap with a dedicated blog for presenting results from
the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research][3] group. Our aim is to
disseminate results to the wider community (including non-scientists), provide
our perspectives on the field, discuss recent trends, provide commentary on
other work (diplomatically!), and discuss BAIR-related things. Our goal is to
publish blog posts at least once a week and at at regularly-spaced intervals.

Posts on this blog are written by BAIR students, post-docs, and faculty.
