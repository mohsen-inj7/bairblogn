## Overview and Blog Purpose

[Berkeley AI Research][3] (BAIR) brings together researchers at UC Berkeley
across the areas of computer vision, machine learning, natural language
processing, planning, and robotics, and each year we publish cutting edge
research across all of these areas. Dissemination of scientific results is a
core component of our mission, and while the traditional avenues for fulfilling
this mission -- publications and presentations at academic conferences --
continue to be the primary method for disseminating our results, we must also
strive to make our results accessible, easily interpretable, and available to
all. As part of this effort, we are launching the BAIR Blog, a general audience
blog where we will present and discuss recent results in computer vision, deep
learning, robotics, NLP, and a variety of other areas where BAIR conducts
cutting-edge research. Our aim with the BAIR Blog will be to present recent
scientific findings in a format that is engaging, accessible, but at the same
time informative for readers with all levels of expertise. Posts on a variety of
other topics will appear on approximately a weekly basis.
